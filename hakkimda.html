			<p class="paragraf">Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm so glad to see you here. I'm Bedirhan as you can see, i'm from Eskisehir and 19 years old. In early years of my life i was keen on football and video games. I played at Kirka Boraksspor as an amateur player. Then I lost interest in football, I thought it wasn't for me and my video games journey began. It was such a joyful thing to do. I was playing relentlessly 8-9 hours a day. I was becoming a unhealthy, obes and unattractive person. This made me sad but i didn't care till my crush rejected me. Years passed by I was still playing video games and eating chips. If i wasn't popular kid in primary and middle school I'd be more strict to myself. Attention was all around me, I was blinded by attention. I guess the popularity came from football. I left football, popularity left me. And I was short that also negative thing on men. In high school I was still short around 5'5, 5'6. In 10th grade I grew taller and my self-esteem improved but Pandemic started, we locked up. Im playing video games, eating chips etc. but there is no end of this journey I had to do something about my life. Luckily we had treadmill in our basement. I began running everyday, eating healthy food and improving myself. Who could ever guessed in cold, uninteresting basement changed my life. Doing push-ups, crunches, pull-ups made my body to Greek God but I didn't satisfy. I was hanging from pull-up bar and making my spine more relaxed which made me taller. I was 6'1 and having a Greek God physique which I dreamed of. My life has completely changed in the pandemic. Everyone complaning about being in "cell" I was improving myself constantly. I started learning classical guitar, I learnt very much but university exam came and I had to study. I pretty much forgot how to play. 12th grade was my favourite year. I'm healthy, popular again and had great friendships but it last short. I dropped school and begin studying online. I didn't regret at all because I learned every decision I made makes me stronger. I didn't study 1 more year and took my result as a lesson and got admitted by Adnan Menderes University. So far so good I'm happy here. I like Aydin very much it's a warm and touristic place, there are lots of places to visit. So long story short I'm now healthy, 200pounds, having great relationships and nice family. Family comes first. I'd like to thank my parents to keep believing in me and never let me down while i was chubby, rebel. That's all folks. Take care!  </p>
